<h3>What is K-Drama?</h3>
<p>K-drama is short for “Korean drama” which pertains to television series created in South Korea. 
    These series have become popular not only in Korea but globally, making them more accessible for 
    K-drama fans through streaming websites like Netflix. Along with other Korean entertainment, such as K-pop and Korean movies, Kdramas have fueled the Korean 
    Wave, which has been constantly expanding worldwide.
</p>


<h3>Brief history:</h3>
<p>
    The roots of television in South Korea go back to the mid-1950s, with the first Korean TV 
    series broadcasting in 1962. It was broadcasted on KBS, Korean Broadcasting System, which has 
    continued to exist as Korea's big national channel. However, it wasn't until the 1970s that 
    Korean households properly began buying television sets. Most South Korean television series 
    depicted historical times and historical figures only reached a small audience. After the surge 
    of TVs in Korean homes, more diverse South Korean dramas began getting made, from national heroes 
    such as King Sejong to tales of regular present-day people, especially their struggles and 
    sufferings.
